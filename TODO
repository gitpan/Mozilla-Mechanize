A lot of cleaning up, docs

Tests

Suppress annoying confirmation dialog when submitting a form
for the first time (thereafter saved in profile).

Several methods from Link, etc., aren't implemented yet

Basic authentication is unimplemented
(not sure how to set headers - possibly nsIWebNavigation
if I can figure out nsIInputStream)

Currently Gtk2::MozEmbed is the hardcoded agent used.
Would be better if you could plug in your own browser code.
